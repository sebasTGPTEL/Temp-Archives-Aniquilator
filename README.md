WARNING
This script may be not allowed to erase the files if it's not opened with admin previligies.
The current version of the script only works for my system, if you trynna use it, change the line 6 on temparchives1.py to your actually system paths
The current version of the script won't going to create the directory for the logs.txt. Change the line 14 on temparchives1.py to a path you wanna use as the logs cointainer, if the provided path does not exist, the script are going to create it.
This issues are going to be solved in newer versions of the script.
Thanks for the support.
